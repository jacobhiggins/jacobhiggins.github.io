In my graduate research, I can often stay on just one subject for long periods of time. For example, I might look at optimal control theory in effort to show stability, only to jump to machine learning and work with that for a while. When this happens, I find myself asking simple questions that I used to know really well, but have since somewhat forgotten, or at least the details have gotten fuzzy. This happened with Laplace Transforms recently, and so I wanted to make a quick blog post detailing a very high-level understanding of why they work and how they fit in with control theory, which is a discussion that is sorely missing in a lot of control theory text books.

What is the Laplace Transform?
===

The formal definition of the Laplace transform is given below:

\begin{equation}
F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt
\end{equation}

<!-- \begin{equation}
\ddot{r} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\\\
0 \\
-g
\end{bmatrix} + 
R
\begin{pmatrix}
\displaylines{
0 \\\
0 \\\\
\Sigma F_i/m}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation} -->
