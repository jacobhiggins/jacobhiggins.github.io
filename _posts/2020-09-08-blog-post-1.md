One thing that I think is sorely missing from a lot of texts and online resources that talk about the Laplace transform is a high-level, not-so-mathy discussion on the intuition behind the Laplace transform. This sort of discussion might not only be helpful to a beginner to the subject of control, but also to a long-time practitioner that needs a refresher after several months on another project (like myself). In this blog post, I talk about several high-level concepts regarding the Laplace transform so that it hopefully becomes more intuitive and less abstract for anyone that works with them in control theory.

What does the Laplace Transform do?
===

Before we jump into formal definitions, let's quickly talk about the general idea behind transforms. Take the following vector that I've drawn:



The formal definition of the Laplace transform is given below:

\begin{equation}
F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt
\end{equation}

This definition of the Laplace transform is often connected with the Fourier transform, which is given by:

\begin{equation}
F(s) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)e^{-i\omega t} dt
\end{equation}

This connection is 

<!-- \begin{equation}
\ddot{r} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\\\
0 \\
-g
\end{bmatrix} + 
R
\begin{pmatrix}
\displaylines{
0 \\\
0 \\\\
\Sigma F_i/m}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation} -->
