One thing that I think is sorely missing from a lot of texts and online resources that talk about the Laplace transform is a high-level, not-so-mathy discussion on the intuition behind the Laplace transform. This sort of discussion might not only be helpful to a beginner to the subject of control, but also to a long-time practitioner that needs a refresher after several months on another project (like myself). In this blog post, I talk about several high-level concepts regarding the Laplace transform so that it hopefully becomes more intuitive and less abstract for anyone that works with them in control theory.

What does the Laplace Transform do?
===

Before we jump into formal definitions, let's quickly talk about the general idea behind transforms. Take the following vector that I've drawn:

</p>

How I've drawn it, the vector points equally in the x-direction and y-direction, so it might be define by $<1,1>$ (ignoring magnitude). But this definition is entirely defined by the basis. If instead I a different basis:

</p>

In this prime basis, the vector clear is along the x' direction more that the y', so it might be defined by $<0.99,0.01>$ (again, ignoring magnitude concerns). The point is the same vector can be described in different ways, and if I were to go from one basis to another, I would merely be _transforming_ the information that is always there.

That, in a very small nutshell, is the big idea behind transforms: having different ways of defining the exact same information. This is exactly what the Laplace transform does, and you could really skip to the next section if you wanted to. The rest of this section talks about what kind of basis the Laplace transform is actually looking at.

The formal definition of the Laplace transform is given below:

\begin{equation}
F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt
\end{equation}

This definition of the Laplace transform is often connected with the Fourier transform, which is given by:

\begin{equation}
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)e^{-i\omega t} dt
\end{equation}

This connection is made by setting $s=i\omega$ and changing the lower bound on the integral to $0$ in the Laplace transform. Clearly, the jump from Fourier to Laplace is a very small one, so I often like to think of the Laplace in terms of Fourier. The Fourier transform takes a function that is defined in time or space and transforms it to a frequency space, so that the function $F(\omega)$ describes the magnitude of the sinusoidal signal at frequency $\omega$ that comprises the time signal f(t).

A more in depth discussion of the Fourier transform is beyond the scope of this blog post, but many good resources can be found online. When thinking about what the variable $s$ really means in the Laplace transform, I often set $s=i\omega$ and image I'm looking at the Fourier decomposition. In this way, I can get a better intuition about what exactly is happening in my control system.

Applying Laplace Transforms in Control Theory
===

With an understanding of what the Laplace Transform does, let's turn to how its used in control theory. There are two ways that a Laplace analysis can show up in control:
- Transforming a signal
- Finding a transfer function

The idea is simple: we have a signal that is defined in time, and we have things (e.g. low-pass filter) that change the signal, also a function of time. What if instead of working exclusively with time, we work with the Laplace $s$ variable instead? We describe the signal with $s$ (transforming a signal) and we describe how that signal is changed in the $s$ basis as it passes through the system (transfer function). A priori, we have no reason to believe that this would help. But it does help a lot.

Again, almost any text book or online source talks about these ideas individually, so I will not really dive into the details, but instead will provide a some examples.
