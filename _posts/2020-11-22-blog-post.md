### How do you move around a corner?

The above question doesn't refer the mechanics of moving around a corner -- that part is simply turning either left or right, making sure you don't hit the wall. What makes the question interesting, though, is not knowing what is _around_ the corner. If you wake up in the middle of the night and need to pee, you might reason that no one is awake and so you are free to cut around the corners in your house as you scramble for the bathroom. If however you are jogging and need to round the corner of a busy intersection, you might choose to safely stay away from the corner until you know that there isn't someone or something you will run into. This kind of reasoning is natural for a human to use, but is harder to program for autonomous mobile robots (AMR).

Why care about how well AMR can move around corners?
