### How do you fuse measurements together?

The first time you learn about probabilistic robotics, you will probably hear about the [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter). The Kalman filter is a way of estimating the state of a system that has both process noise and measurement noise. Founded in probability theory, it gives an optimal estimate based on the relative size of the process and measurement noise. If the process noise is very large and the measurement noise is very small, then the Kalman filter returns an estimated state that is closer to the measurement, and vice versa. For most students that first encounter the Kalman filter, you're told the intuition, shown some complicated multivariate Gaussian math and are told to use it in a homework exercise.
